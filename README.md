## ⚙️ Lumos-1 Installation

This code builds heavily on [Chameleon](https://github.com/facebookresearch/chameleon) and [Lumina-mGPT](https://github.com/Alpha-VLLM/Lumina-mGPT). Therefore, the installation for Lumos-1 generally follows that of Lumina-mGPT.

Please refer to [INSTALL.md](lumos-1/INSTALL.md) for detailed instructions.

> **Note that before using the Lumos-1 model for training or inference, cd to your lumos-1 path and activate your environment or set your python path in files under `eval/` folder.**:
> ```bash
> cd Lumos-Project/lumos-1/lumos-1
> conda activate lumos-1-public
> ```

## 📽️ Lumos-1 Inference

### Visual Tokenizer Preparation

Lumos-1 depends on discrete visual tokenizers like COSMOS.
In our implementation, we adopted COSMOS-DV4x8x8.
We can download the weights on [COSMOS huggingface projects](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Cosmos-Tokenizer-DV8x8x8) to local (i.e., Cosmos-Tokenizer-DV4x8x8/) for visual tokenization.
The paths are organized as follows:

```
Lumos_Projects
-lumos-1
    - lumos-1/
        - ckpts/
            - cosmos/
                - tokenizer/
                    - text_tokenizer.json
                - Cosmos-Tokenizer-DV4x8x8/
                    - autoencoder.jit
                    - config.json
                    - decoder.jit
                    - encoder.jit
                    - model_config.yaml
    - xllmx/
- ...
```

### Running on Benchmarks


- **GenEval**: We provide code to generate images in formats that are suitable for GenEval evaluation. For detailed GenEval installation, please refer to their [official repo](https://github.com/djghosh13/geneval). Images can be generated by running the following commands:
    ```bash 
    bash eval/inference_geneval.sh
    ```
    The following code will generate images by running parallelly on `i` number of cards. You can adjust this number according to your own machine.

- **VBench-I2V**: To evaluate on VBench-I2V, we need to download the images from the [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fdOZKQ7HWZtgutCKKA7CMzOhMFUGv4Zx?usp=sharing) and then configure the path in `inference_i2v.py` to reveal your image path:
    ```python
    eval_data_collection = {
        "vbench-i2v-7-4": {
            "video_path": "/YOUR/IMAGE/PATH/vbench-i2v/crop/7-4/",
            "caption_path": "eval/prompts/vbench2_i2v_full_info_qwen32b_vl.json",
        },
    }
    ```
    You can then smoothly run the commands to generate videos in formats that are suitable for VBench-I2V evaluation. 
    ```bash
    bash eval/inference_vbench_i2v.sh
    ```
    For deatiled VBench-I2V installation and evaluation, you can refer to the [VBench repo](https://github.com/Vchitect/VBench/tree/master/vbench2_beta_i2v).


- **VBench-T2V**: We provide code to generate videos in formats that are suitable for VBench-T2V evaluation. Videos can be generated by running the following commands:
    ```bash
    bash eval/inference_vbench_t2v.sh
    ```
    For deatiled VBench-T2V installation and evaluation, you can refer to the [VBench repo](https://github.com/Vchitect/VBench).


### Running on custom T2I / I2V / T2V data
The part below contains instructions for inference with your own data.
> ********************************************************************************************************************
> **Note**: To ensure better performance, you'd better use detailed prompts since we train on long and descriptive prompts.
> ********************************************************************************************************************

- **T2I**: The repo supports custom T2I inference by providing your own detailed text prompts. You can specify the prompts in `inference_t2i.py`, where prompts are given by the dictionary:
    ```python
    eval_data_collection = {
        "custom_t2i": {
            "caption_path": "eval/prompts/custom_t2i_prompts.jsonl",
        },
    }
    ```
    After setting your own prompts, you can run the command to perform inference for customized generation:
    ```bash 
    bash eval/inference_custom_t2i.sh
    ```

- **I2V**: The repo supports custom I2V inference by providing your own image and text prompts. You can specify the information in `inference_i2v.py`, where prompts and the images are given by the dictionary:
    ```python
    eval_data_collection = {
            "custom_i2v_data": {
                "video_path": "eval/custom_i2v_1_frame",
                "caption_path": "eval/prompts/custom_i2v_prompts.json",
            },
        }
    ```
    After setting your own prompts and images, you can run the command to perform inference with them:
    ```bash 
    bash eval/inference_custom_i2v.sh
    ```

- **T2V**: The repo supports custom T2V inference by providing your own text prompts. You can specify the informaiton in `eval/inference_custom_i2v.sh`, where prompts are given by the dictionary:
    ```python
    eval_data_collection = {
        "custom_t2v": {
            "video_path": "",
            "caption_path": "eval/prompts/custom_t2v_prompts.json",
        },
    }
    ```
    After setting your own prompts, you can run the command to perform inference:
    ```bash 
    bash eval/inference_custom_t2v.sh
    ```


## ⛽ Lumos-1 Fine-tuning

### Pre-tokenization
To ensure fast training, we pre-tokenize the data so that the model can directly train on token sequences without the need to tokenize the data online. Note that **this pre-tokenization process support various aspect ratios**, therefore technically, you can use visual data in any common resolution.

- **Step 1**: *CSV file preparation*. Prepare two csv files containing all images/videos used for fine-tuning. We provide two examples placed under `Lumos-Project/lumos-1/lumos-1/pre_tokenize/csv_files`. One csv contains image data and one csv contains video data.

- **Step 2**: *Pre-tokenize data*. We can run the commands for pre-tokenization as:
    ```bash
    bash pre_tokenize/run_tokenization.sh
    ```
    We take image pre-tokenization as an example and show it below. 
    ```bash
    # Step 1: pre-tokenize
    python pre_tokenize/parallel_tokenization_image.py

    # Step 2: obtain data json
    python -u pre_tokenize/concat_record.py  \
    --sub_record_dir  pre_tokenize/data/test_image  \
    --save_path       pre_tokenize/data/test_image/merge-record.json \
    --merge_sub_tasks \
    ```
    When runnning `python pre_tokenize/parallel_tokenization_image.py`, if you want to pre-tokenize the data to 384p, set `--target_size 528` (i.e., (384+672)/2 = 528); if you want to pre-tokenize the data to 256p, set `--target_size 352` (i.e., (256+448)/2 = 352). 

- **Step 3**: *Set config file*. After obtaining the collective json file by runnning `python pre_tokenize/concat_record.py`, we modify the paths in our yaml files placed under `Lumos-Project/lumos-1/lumos-1/configs/data`, which are used for fine-tuning the model.

### Fine-tuning
To fine-tune the model, we can run the corresponding training scripts as:
```bash
# 1B Image generation fine-tuning
bash exps/1B_Stage_1_Image.sh
# Image generation fine-tuning
bash exps/3B_Stage_1_Image.sh
# Image/Video joint fine-tuning
bash exps/1B_Stage_2_JointTraining.sh
# Image/Video joint fine-tuning
bash exps/3B_Stage_2_JointTraining.sh
```

Please remember to:
- download the pre-trained weights and configure the path;
- adjust the batch sizes so that it matches the batch size limit of your specific machine (I set it to 1 by default);
- (Optional) uncomment these lines so that the code can run eval [eval_in_epoch] times in every epoch.
```bash 
--eval_in_epoch 200 \
--eval_mode  text_to_video \
--run_eval \
```
